# Bunny-Flop
A tool (hack) for cs 1.6

# What is this tool?
Is a simple tool that was used when the game was very famous (2006-2010) and allows you to bhop (after I explain what it is)

# What is bhopping?
It is a technique used by CS pros to move faster.
To do this you have to jump point in a specific direction (either right or left) and move.
Here is an explanatory video:
